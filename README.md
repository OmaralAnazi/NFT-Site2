# NFT Site - Responsive Edition

## Description
The revamped "NFT Site" is an updated version of the original, now featuring a fully responsive design. This guided project from the Scrimba Front-End Developer Program adheres to responsive design principles, ensuring the site is optimized for an array of devices, from mobiles to desktop PCs.

## Technologies
- HTML
- CSS

## Learnings
- Implemented responsive design using relative units like rem for font sizes and em for margins and padding.
- Utilized percentage values for widths to create flexible containers and images.
- Employed max-width in pixels to ensure consistency across different screen sizes.
- Defined common breakpoints for media queries, catering to mobiles, tablets, laptops, and desktops.
- Adopted a mobile-first approach, starting with a design that stacks elements vertically on smaller screens before expanding the layout for larger devices.
